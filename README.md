# Project-Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health
Exploring the students data using PostgreSQL, I find out whether the length of stay for international students is a contributing factor to the students' mental health.

Tools used:
1. PostgreSQL
2. SQL (Aliasing, COUNT, ROUND, AVG, Filtering, Grouping, and Sorting)
